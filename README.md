# Crack Segmentation

## Introduction

This page provides some codes of **crack segmenation** on two datasets: **CrackSeg9k** and **cumstomized dataset**, which include **visible light** images, **infrared** images, and **depth** images.

### Notice

**1.** Inside the python files, the directory should changed.

**2.** Make sure checking the relationship between each files and directories instead of customized dataset since it is complicated inside.

**3.** The file related to CrackSeg9k can't execute successfully since CrackSeg9k doesn't upload to GitHub and it has some modification.

### The content in the files

**cunstomized dataset**：mainly all the images including visible light images, infrared images, and depth images.

**models**：various of upsampling and downsampling models.

**others**：including visualize the results and some files that can get the information of the model.

**performance**：all the statistic during the experiment.

**training files**：all the .py files that can train the model.

**information.txt**：initial version of recording the steps of the experiment.

## Special Thanks

**1.** If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants," said Newton. During my research, Adam Cheng has been a giant to me. He completed the modification and correction of CrackSeg9k and allowed me to use it.

**2.** **Ray Yang** and **Miles Wu** helped me collecting all the data of customized dataset.
