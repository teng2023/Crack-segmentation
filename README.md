# Crack-segmentation

## Introduction

This page provides some codes of crack segmenation on two datasets: **CrackSeg9k** and **cumstomized dataset**, whcih include visible light images, infrared images, and depth images.

### The content in the files

**cunstomized dataset**：mainly all the images including visible light images, infrared images, and depth images.

**models**：various of upsampling and downsampling models.

**others**：including visualize the results and some files that can get the information of the model.

**performance**：all the statistic during the experiment.

**training files**：all the .py files that can train the model.
